**\#DataRescue[EventName]** brings together concerned citizens with experts in information technology, archiving and environmental science and policy. We need capable web-savvy and technical members of the public, librarians, and people with environmental expertise. Building on experience from similar events, everyone’s skills will be put to work in organized cooperation.

Data Rescue [EventName] works to secure federal environmental data in advance of the Trump administration’s large-scale efforts to dismantle environmental regulation. This work is urgent since the Trump administration has vowed to cull crucial data from its websites.

Join us for a day of preserving valuable environmental data from attempts to undermine science in the public service. Bring your laptop, water bottle and snacks.
